# verify-me
A plugin that checks all rel="me" links are reciprocal, doing distributed verification

It no longer uses the indiewebify.me link checker service, instead adopting the local technique from https://github.com/Zegnat/verify-me-locally

# Privacy policy
No user information is stored or sent remotely, so there are no longer privacy implications from using this extension. 
However, it will fetch linked-to sites from the browser when you click the icon, 
so your IP address, timestamp and other browser information may be communicated to those sites.
